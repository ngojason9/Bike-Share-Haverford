## Getting Started

### Introduction
The Blue Bike Share Program was offered by the Committee of Environmental Responsibility (CER) at Haverford College. The program aims to make bicycles accessible to students who might find them difficult to purchase or only need them for short-term use. It provides an environmentally friendly, fun, and convenient way for students to get around!
